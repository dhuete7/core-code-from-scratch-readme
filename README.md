1) Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages

-Compiled langauges are those that can be read more directly by a machine's logical processor there is a "build" formed to execute a set of instructions the environment/machine need to construct the "build" every time you request the program to run 

-Interpreted languages use a structure and resources in a way where the machine is able to read and perform instructions line by line without the need
to read the whole of a "build" and can adopt to changes on the run like in pythoh, javascript and others

2) Is Java an interpreted or compiled langauge?

Java uses a process where there is first a source code is compiled to bytecode by an environment compiler
then the bytecode is executed or interpreted on the Java virtual machine , in the present Java virtual machines can use a "Just in time" compiulation of instructions to execute instructions on the fly.
Therefore it can be said that Java is both interpreted and compiled 

3) pseudocode- currency converter:

START

PRINT "Enter an ammount of dollars"

AMMOUT <-- GET

BTCVAL <-- 30000

CONVERSION<-- AMMOUNT * BTCVAL

PRINT CONVERSION

END
